# (Work in progress) Leetcode Trainer

https://www.joshmanzano.com/leetcode-trainer/

A leetcode trainer that helps organize the amount and order of problems you need to learn in order to be competent in Leetcode.

Problems are shown from easy -> medium -> hard.

Once a problem has been seen (solved or unsolved), it is placed into a queue.

The trainer will go through this queue once all problems have been seen.

Made with React.js, all data is stored on the browser.
